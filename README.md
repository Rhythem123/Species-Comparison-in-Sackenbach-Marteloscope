# Forest Growth Analysis of Sackenbach Marteloscope (2015-2021)

## Introduction

This project investigates the diameter growth and height growth of various tree species within the "Sackenbach" marteloscope over a seven-year period (2015-2021). The study focuses on comparing growth patterns among four distinct quadrants within the marteloscope.

A marteloscope is a one-hectare rectangular forest area where all trees are systematically numbered, mapped, and recorded. The Sackenbach marteloscope is divided into four subplots, each 50 meters by 50 meters. Various tree parameters such as location, height, diameter at breast height (DBH), tree ID, and crown base height are measured. Derived parameters like stem volume and basal area are computed from these measurements.

Marteloscopes are valuable tools for silviculture training, offering educational resources for forest practitioners, decision makers, scientists, students, and other communities. They support policy dialogue and field trips, enhancing forestry educational programs and improving biodiversity integration into forest management.

## Tree Species in Sackenbach Marteloscope

The Sackenbach marteloscope hosts a variety of tree species, including:

- Birke
- Larch
- Oak
- Pine
- Spruce
- Beech
- Fir

Species composition varies across the quadrants. For example:
- Plot 2: Oak, Pine, Spruce, Beech
- Plot 3: Spruce, Beech, Oak, Fir, Larch, Pine

Observations indicate that certain plots favor the growth of specific species in terms of height and diameter. Similarly, the entire marteloscope supports varying growth rates for different species.

## Objective

This study aims to visualize and report the differences in diameter and height growth of various tree species using bar graphs and scatter plots.

## Conclusion

After analyzing the data from the Sackenbach marteloscope, the following conclusions were drawn:
- Fir species exhibit the greatest diameter growth.
- Larch species exhibit the highest height growth rate.
- Oak trees show the lowest growth rates in both diameter and height.
